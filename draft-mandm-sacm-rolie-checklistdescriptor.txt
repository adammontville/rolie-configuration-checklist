       Definition of the ROLIE configuration checklist Extension
           draft-mandm-sacm-rolie-configuration-checklist-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core by defining a new information-type to ROLIE's
   atom:category pertaining to security configuration checklists.
   Additional supporting requirements are also defined that describe the
   use of specific formats and link relations pertaining to the new
   information-type.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie] to support the publication of configuration
   checklist information.  Many enterprises operate according to
   guidance provided to them by a control framework
   ([CIS_Critical_Controls], [PCI_DSS], [NIST_800-53] etc.), which often
   prescribe that an enterprise define a standard, secure configuration
   for each technology they operate.  Such standard secure
   configurations are often referred to as configuration checklists.
   These configuration checklists contain a set of configuration
   recommendations for a given endpoint.  A configuration recommendation
   prescribes expected values pertaining to one or more discrete
   endpoint attributes.

2.  Terminology

   Configuration Checklist  TBD

   Configuration Item  Generally synonymous with endpoint attribute.

   Configuration Recommendation  TBD

   TODO: Others??  TBD

3.  ROLIE Extensions and Registrations

3.1.  atom:category:information-type Extension

   The "configuration-checklist" information type represents a body of
   information describing a set of configuration recommendations.  A
   configuration recommendation is, minimally, a configuration item
   paired with a recommended value or range of values.  Depending on the
   source, a configuration recommendation may carry with it additional
   information (i.e. description, references, rationale, etc.).  The
   purpose of the configuration-checklist information-type is to
   identify the set of recommendations and not individual
   recommentations.

3.2.  rolie:format Extension

   TODO: Need to verify that the rolie:format element can be used for at
   least the following sets of formats: XCCDF, XCCDF+OVAL, SCAP,
   XCCDF+X, XCCDF+OVAL+SCE, and so on.  Would all of these simply be
   "XCCDF"?  (If so, that seems less helpful.)

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for use of
   the rolie:format element.

3.3.  atom:link Registrations

   TODO: Can there be multiple of these links?  For example, I really
   want more than one target-platform and more than one profile.
